IMPORTANT:
While this project is technically working, it is not recommended to run it in a production environment yet.

The goal of this project is to create a working example of Drools Planner in a Web based environment. 
Drools Planner is a platform that can solve planning problems using meta-heuristic algorithms such as Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing.
Due to the nature of the meta-heuristic algorithms, the solver will almost always produce different solutions even with the same input data.

For the non-algorithmic part this project uses Java EE 6 technologies such as JPA, CDI and JSF 2 as well as some modules from Seam Framework 3.
